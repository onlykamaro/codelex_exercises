// Imagine you own a gun store. Only certain guns can be purchased with license types.
// Create an object (person) that will be the requester to purchase a gun (object).
// Person object has a name, valid licenses (multiple) & cash.
// Guns are objects stored within an array. Each gun has license letter, price & name.
// Using PHP in-built functions determine if the requester (person) can buy a gun from the store.
